/*
Comparison Operator:
Compare

1) == -> equal to (numbers are equal in value)
e.g:
  3 == 4; -> false
  2 == "2" -> true (because it only comapres value not data type)

2) === -> strict equal to (numbers are equal in value and data type)
e.g:
  3 === 4; false
  2 === "2"; false (because data type of 2 is number and data type of "2" is string)
